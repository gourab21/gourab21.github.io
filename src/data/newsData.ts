    summary: "Next-Gen Secure UAV: Leveraging Hyperelliptic Curves and Particle Swarm Optimization.",
    content: "This study proposes a lightweight cryptographic framework for UAV communication, integrating Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Using genus-2 curves over a 256-bit prime field, it enables secure Diffie-Hellman key exchange with AES encryption and SHA3-256. PSO optimizes key length, AES size, and rotation intervals, adapting to network conditions. A dynamic key rotation manager enhances resilience against attacks like MITM and brute-force. Results show improved entropy and security, offering an efficient solution for UAVâ€“Ground Control Station communication.",
